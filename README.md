# Open Circle

> Open circle is a study project done at the University of Applied Science Potsdam by Bela Kurek ([@q-rec](https://github.com/q-rec)) and [Lucas Vogel](https://vogelino.com) ([@vogelino](https://github.com/vogelino)) in the winter semester 2016-2017. The project has been realised in collaboration with the _Center for Contemporary Practices in Berlin_ [Agora Collective](http://agoracollective.org/) and _Berlin's public cleansing service_ the [Berliner Stadtreinigung](https://www.bsr.de/) in the course CIRCULAR ECONOMY supervised by [Alexandra Martini](http://alexandramartini.com/).

> The berlin-based center for contemporary practices offers co-working spaces, artists- and dance- studios as well as a caf√© and an event space which they all tender with sustainability in mind. The idea behind the project was to help the Agora Collective with ideas and creations to improve their integration in a circular economy. 


## Introduction
We, Bela Kurek and Lucas Vogel, are two interface design students and mostly took part to the course for its very interesting and until then for us rather unexplored topic: The Circular Economy.
From the beginning we saw an opportunity to use our skills as interface designers to digitally support Agora in their aim. We both did made many experiences in the world of open source development and became early the idea to combine open source with circular economy.

A related project called [OSCE-Days](https://oscedays.org/) tried to reach a similar goal with a community forum and events, in which professional of different fields of expertise can exchange their ideas for a more circular and sustainable world. Nevertheless, because of the restricted collaboration on their forum, we saw the potential of creating a web platform that better combines the advantages of open source development and the goals of the circular economy.

## Research, inspiration & idea
We took most of our inspiration from the version control tool git and the online community website [Github](https://github.com/), which allows developers to work on a same code base simultaneously and therefor, to reach efficiency and better code quality. [Github.com](https://github.com/) is one of the most visited website in the world ([rank 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites) at the time of writing) and big companies like Facebook also open sourced [some of their own code projects](https://code.facebook.com/projects/) on it, taking advantage of the community to improve their tools and gain in popularity. This makes it one additional reason to take github as our main inspiration.

The idea of collaboration within communities is very important to us and has already proved itself efficient in the software world. The more people take part of a project, the greater does its quality increase. This could almost be transferred one to one to circular economy projects, as many individuals together bring more productivity and critical minds with them.
On this account, we decided to create an online tool that allows collaboration and sharing in an easy way, witch serves as a home for great ideas that can be continuously improved and motivates professionals and amateurs in their engagement for a more sustainable and clean world.

## Concept
Our solution is meant for individual users as well as for communities or enterprises. With it, it should be possible to present and share its own circular economy related knowledge. This requirement brought us to split the website into four different sections:

#### Users
An individual user of the website. Anyone wanting to write something or to contribute to a project needs to create an account. Without an account, most of the contents remain open and readable by anyone but it isn't possible to actively take part to anything.

#### Communities
A community is a group of users that want to work together on particular projects. This can be a collective, like Agora, an enterprise or even a group of friends that meet online. Communities can be used to communicate internal goals to the outside world and to work on common fields together with like-minded people.

#### Recipes
Recipes describe a knowledge in the circular economy field. This goes from the right waste separation to the reuse of waste material in large industries. This is a theoretical approach, which can be used in practice and leads from slightly different or totally different results.

#### Projects
A project can consist of many recipes and can be seen as the practical application of a knowledge. A project should not just describe a product/result as is but also the process in which it has been created and how it integrates in a circular economy. This could be the Agora's growhouse or the Timberland's creation of Shoe soles made of plastic waste.
